      <p>To think about how AI has evolved over the past few years is crazy and can look threatening to some of us. 
      Especially to those who work close to social media and designing in general. AI has evolved so much that it 
      can now design websites and houses or any other type of stuff for us by the click of a few buttons and by a 
      few description words about what we want. And what I think about all of this when considering AI is that when 
      comparing us humans and our designs and critical thinking AI has no power. Sure AI can design and make incredible
       designs that some of us probably haven't thought of. But I would like to propose that AI is more like a trend 
       follower and depends on us to survive. </p>

<p>Without us and our old designs that are now everywhere in the internet is what AI thrives off of.
 If it was not for our original designs AI would be nothing. Which is why I think that when it comes to AI 
 It cannot compare to us because we are the originals and the ones that come up with new creative ideas. And AI
  is only there to follow and create something unoriginal. Sure we have all used AI at some point and I admit I have 
  as well. When using it I notice how easy it is to understand what we want and when you ask it to get straight to it,
   it understands. When using AI it is helpful but I would also like to say that AI makes things in a way that you 
   could easily tell it looks noticeably made by AI and not a human being. </p>

<p>AI is also biased. Since AI is made on biased training holding data that is very well liked only being able to produce 
things that are obviously biased and trending. Becoming dependent on AI shows a decline in original thinking skills
 and critical decision making skills. I would also like to state that AI could never really beat an original critical
  thinking designer. With that will always come critical thinking and more in depth and creates more meaning to the
   designs on why certain colors or choices were made. AI can only do so much but can't add meaning and depth to
    designs and other things like humans do. </p>

<p>The sense of originality and new would be erased by AI which is why when it comes to humans AI holds no power.
 AI cannot understand feelings especially when it comes to why we design and choose certain colors or fonts the
  way we do because it all represents something to us and adds more meaning to what we are working on. Unlike
   AI they are simply trend followers and go off what the internet says which also shows how they are simply
    biased trained. Which I also think it's a reason why people feel like AI is powerful because they follow
     the current trend and what they see people liking and what's becoming popular. But all of those trends
      are always being created and designed by humans. </p>

<p>This all goes to show why when it comes to us AI holds no power. Without us AI cannot be the trend follower or 
biased that they can be. If we were to stop relying on the internet or somehow stop sharing our creations on the 
internet AI would be called old and unoriginal, and use of old designs that are so “2022” and so on. AI is only 
here because of the original designers who continue to make new creations and Ideas. While AI can be helpful to 
get started on a design or to start an essay or to get inspiration AI is only there because of us. </p>
